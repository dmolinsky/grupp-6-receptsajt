# Julens Godaste Recept

### _A project-memoir_

> _"The difference between theory and practice is greater in practice than in theory"_

## Foreword

This project was born during the gloomy autumn of 2025.
The leaves fell, deadlines and internships approached, and somewhere in all of this, a group project appeared.

There were meetings where nobody knew what to say.
Sprint reviews where **"you'll learn that next week"** was said.
Dev meetings where nobody knew what was supposed to be done.

Test written when we didn't know what to test.

And more meetings.

## What is this?

This is a web project that:

- Displays recipes fetched from an API (which is probably offline by now).
- Presents the recipes in a nice layout.
- Was built with React, which we barely knew.
    - And not JavaScript either, for that matter.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
npm install
npm run dev
```

If it doesn’t work:  
Ask Johan. He probably won’t give you the answer, but you can try anyway. We did.

## Testning

`npm run test`

If the tests fail, that’s your fault, not ours.  
They worked on _my_ machine.

## Development Log

- Day 1 – "This can’t be that hard."
- Day 7 – "Why **doesn’t** the code work?"
- Day 13 – "Why **does** the code work?"
- Day 21 – "Oh... we were supposed to do that too?"
- Day 30 – "Tests?"

## In Memoriam

- All code that never survived a merge review.
- All great ideas spoken in meetings that never made it into code.
- Kahoot.
- Every medium and low SonarCube warning that will never, ever be fixed.
- `console.log()`, a true hero, commented out but not forgotten.
- The ZAP test report.

## The Teachers

- Johan - Our teach teacher that tried to help us with feedback like:
    - "You could do that."
    - "Yeah that sounds smart."
- Claes - Our agile teacher who gave us the knowledge of the agile mindset. Did it work? I don't know, we kind of improvised on the spot.

## The Team

### Devs of JU24

- Diana - Managed our giant `index.css`
- Eric - Had to do the search function
- Max - Did as little React as possible
- Akash - Rated our rating feature
- Linda - Probably knows the most React

### Project Managers of ITP25

- Angelica - Made the meetings more fun
- Ella - Really likes table tennis
- Emma - Gave the devs baked goods
- Halime - Spreadsheet wizard
- Benjamin - Worked from home

## Contact

Questions? Bugs?  
Ask ChatGPT. It does everything in the end anyway. Probably.
We didn't use it though, promise.

##### PS

<p style="font-size: 0.7rem; color: #777;">
This readme is written very tongue-in-cheek and is mostly not meant to be taken seriously.
We actually learned a lot and had a lot of fun along the way.
